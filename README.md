## What Makes This Special

- **100% Framework-Free Backend**: Raw Python sockets, manual HTTP parsing, custom routing
- **Pure Vanilla Frontend**: Zero JavaScript frameworks - just DOM manipulation and fetch API
- **Custom Database**: JSON-based ORM built from scratch with auto-persistence
- **Manual HTTP Protocol**: Hand-crafted request/response handling
- **Async Non-blocking Server**: Built with Python `select` for concurrent connections

## Learning Journey

This project was my deep dive into **low-level web fundamentals**:
- Understanding HTTP protocol from ground up
- Socket programming and network communication
- Building database abstractions without ORMs

**Next Goal**: Building a mini web framework from these learnings

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run - that's it!
git clone https://github.com/kevinnadar22/HTTP-Server
cd HTTP-Server
python main.py
```

Open http://localhost:8000 - Your notes app is ready! âœ“


## âœ“ Features
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Real-time search and responsive design
- Auto-saving database and modern UI
- Concurrent connections and error handling
- HTTP compliance and RESTful API
